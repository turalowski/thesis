## Introduction

The todo application is a simple yet powerful tool to manage your tasks and stay organized. It allows you to create, update, and delete tasks, as well as mark them as completed. Each framework's implementation offers a unique development experience and has its own strengths and features.

## Folder Structure

The repository is organized into the following folders:

1. `react-app`: Contains the React implementation of the todo application.
2. `vue-app`: Contains the Vue.js implementation of the todo application.
3. `angular-app`: Contains the Angular implementation of the todo application.
4. `svelte-app`: Contains the Svelte implementation of the todo application.

Each folder includes the necessary files and configurations specific to its respective framework. Refer to the individual readme files within each folder for more details on their specific setup and usage.

## Installation

To set up any of the todo applications, follow the instructions provided in the respective folder's readme file. Each framework has its own dependencies and build process, so make sure you have the necessary tools installed on your machine.

## Usage
